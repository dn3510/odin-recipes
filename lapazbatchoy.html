		<h2>La Paz Batchoy an Ilonggo delicacy</h2>
		<p>
			Batchoy is a soup dish composed of sliced pork, pig’s innards, and miki noodles.This
			dish originated from the district of La Paz in Iloilo City — in the island of Panay.
			Throughout the years, batchoy gained popularity and has been a favorite soup dish along
			with beef mami, beef pares, and bulalo.The miki noodles used in this recipe refers to
			fresh egg noodles. This type of noodle is often used in soup dishes. Since the noodles
			are fresh, it requires minimal cooking time. Sometimes, pouring hot broth over the
			noodles is enough to cook it.
		</p>
		<p>
			Traditional batchoy recipe requires the use of shrimp paste or guinamus (or guinamos).
			Unlike regular shrimp paste or bagoong, the shrimp paste used in traditional batchoy are
			sold in small blocks. It is usually mixed in water and boiled until the flavor comes
			out. It is later strained and the liquid is added to the broth or caldo. If you can’t
			find this type of guinamus, you can always use regular shrimp paste – like what I did.
