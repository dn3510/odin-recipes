		<h3>What is Dinuguan</h3>
		<p>
			Dinuguan is a Filipino savory stew usually of pork offal (typically lungs, kidneys,
			intestines, ears, heart and snout) and/or meat simmered in a rich, spicy dark gravy of
			pig blood, garlic, chili (most often siling haba), and vinegar.
		</p>
		<p>
			This dish is rather similar to European-style blood sausage, or British and Irish black
			pudding in a saucy stew form.It is perhaps closer in appearance and preparation to the
			Polish soup Czernina or an even more ancient Spartan dish known as melas zomos (black
			soup) whose primary ingredients were pork, vinegar and blood.
		</p>
		<p>
			Dinuguan can also be served without using any offal, using only choice cuts of pork. In
			Batangas, this version is known as sinungaok. It can also be made from beef and chicken
			meat, the latter being known as dinuguang manok ('chicken dinuguan'). Dinuguan is
			usually served with white rice or a Philippine rice cake called puto. The Northern Luzon
			versions of the dish, namely the Ilocano dinardaraan and the Ibanag zinagan are often
			drier with toppings of deep-fried pork intestine cracklings. The Itawes of Cagayan also
			have a pork-based version that has larger meat chunks and more fat, which they call
			twik.
		</p>
		<p>
			The most important ingredient of the dinuguan recipe, pig's blood, is used in many other
			Asian cuisines either as coagulated blood acting as a meat extender or as a mixture for
			the broth itself. Pork dinuguan is the latter.
		</p>
		<p>
			The dish is not consumed by religious groups that have dietary laws prohibiting the
			consumption of blood, most notably the indigenous Iglesia Ni Cristo, Jehovah's
			Witnesses, Seventh-day Adventists, and Filipino Jews.
