		<h2>Pansit Molo an Ilonggo delicacy</h2>
		<br />
		<p>
			Pancit Molo also known as Molo Soup is the Filipino version of dumpling or wonton soup.
			Pancit Molo originated from Molo district in Iloilo City which happen to be my hometown.
			There are few versions on how to make Pancit Molo and this is one of the simpler one.
			Simple but very delicious and comforting.
		</p>
		<p>
			Pancit Molo balls or the dumplings used is composed of ground pork, shrimps and basic
			ingredients. The Molo soup is made of chicken breast and shrimp simmered on chicken
			broth and seasoned with basic spices. The main foundation of this Pancit Molo soup
			recipe is a good stock. FYI, in Iloilo City, we call the dumplings Pansit Molo.
		</p>
		<p>
			Pancit Molo is a traditional Ilonggo dish that resembles the Chinese wonton soup with a
			slightly different flavor, but if you ask me, Pancit Molo has more flavor and maybe even
			better.
		</p>
		<p>
			A specialty of Iloilo City, this soup does not have any noodles, but the dumplings or
			Molo balls and the broth make it an incredible snack or a meal itself.
		</p>
		<p>
			The molo balls or the dumplings ingredients creates 60-75 dumplings, but the broth only
			requires 12 dumplings which is good for 3 to 4 servings. The rest can be frozen for
			future use.
		</p>
		<p>
			This simple Pancit Molo recipe is worth a try. Make it now and share with family and
			friends. Make a bunch of the dumplings and save it for later use. Save this recipe or
			Pin It and share! The comforting flavors of pork, shrimp and chicken mix together to a
			create a delicious soup dish.
